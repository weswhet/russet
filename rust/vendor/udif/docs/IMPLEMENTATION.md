# Implementation Notes

This document describes non-obvious implementation details discovered while building this library.

## Tricky Pieces

### 1. Koly Header Position

The koly magic bytes are at **offset -512** from the end of the file, not -4.

```
Wrong:  file_size - 4   = koly magic  ❌
Right:  file_size - 512 = koly magic  ✓
```

The entire koly header is 512 bytes, and "koly" appears at the start of this header.

```rust
// Correct way to check for DMG
fn is_dmg(reader: &mut R) -> bool {
    reader.seek(SeekFrom::End(-512))?;  // Not -4!
    let mut magic = [0u8; 4];
    reader.read_exact(&mut magic)?;
    magic == *b"koly"
}
```

### 2. Mish Block Count Location

The **actual block count** is at offset 200 in the mish header, not offset 36.

```
Offset 36:  Often contains partition index (misleading!)
Offset 200: Contains actual block run count  ✓
```

The field at offset 36 (`block_descriptor_count`) often contains the partition's index or other metadata, not the number of block runs.

```rust
// Wrong
let block_count = read_u32_at_offset(36);  // ❌ Unreliable

// Correct
let block_count = read_u32_at_offset(200); // ✓ Actual count
```

### 3. Mish Header Size is 204 Bytes

The mish header is **204 bytes**, not 200. Block runs start at offset 204.

```
Offset 0-199:   Standard mish fields + checksum
Offset 200-203: Actual block count (4 bytes)
Offset 204+:    Block runs begin
```

This extra 4-byte field is often undocumented but critical for correct parsing.

### 4. LZFSE Buffer Size Requirements

**No longer applies.** The C LZFSE decoder needed a destination buffer *larger*
than the decompressed size, so decoding into an exactly sized buffer could fail
with `BufferTooSmall`, and this crate decoded into 2x scratch and copied back:

```rust
// The old shape, against the C `lzfse` crate
let mut scratch = vec![0u8; expected_size * 2];
let actual_size = lzfse::decode_buffer(&compressed, &mut scratch)?;
```

`lzfse_rust` decodes into a `Vec` that grows as needed, so there is no headroom
rule and no scratch copy:

```rust
let mut decoded = Vec::with_capacity(expected_size);
let actual_size = lzfse_rust::decode_bytes(&compressed, &mut decoded)?;
```

The length check against the block map stayed: see the next section.

### 5. A Compressed Run Decodes to Exactly Its Declared Length

A compressed block run must decode to exactly `sector_count * 512`. Creators
pad the final chunk before compressing it, so the padding is inside the
compressed stream rather than implied by the reader.

```rust
// Wrong - a short decode leaves the tail of the buffer zeroed and returns Ok,
// so fabricated null bytes are indistinguishable from recovered data
let bytes_read = decoder.read(&mut buffer[0..sector_count * 512])?;  // ❌

// Correct - fill the buffer, and fail if the stream cannot
let decoded = read_full(&mut decoder, &mut buffer[0..sector_count * 512])?;
if decoded != sector_count * 512 { return Err(...); }  // ✓
```

Verified against the fixture images: every one of their 1929 compressed runs,
across LZFSE, XZ and zlib, decodes to exactly its declared length.
`libdmg-hfsplus` compresses exactly `sectorCount * SECTOR_SIZE` per run and
asserts the read returned that much.

Note that `dmg2img` inflates to the end of the stream and writes whatever it
gets, without comparing against the declared count, so it accepts images this
crate now rejects.

Before 0.4.0 this crate's own writer stored a short trailing chunk under a run
declaring a full sector, and its reader relied on a pre-zeroed output buffer to
paper over the gap. Both sides are fixed; images written by earlier versions no
longer read.

### 6. Block Run Size is Fixed

Each block run is **exactly 40 bytes**. This is critical for parsing.

```
Block Run (40 bytes):
├── block_type:        4 bytes (u32 BE)
├── comment:           4 bytes (u32 BE)
├── sector_number:     8 bytes (u64 BE)
├── sector_count:      8 bytes (u64 BE)
├── compressed_offset: 8 bytes (u64 BE)
└── compressed_length: 8 bytes (u64 BE)
                      ────────────────
                      40 bytes total
```

### 7. Koly Header Padding

The koly header must be **exactly 512 bytes**. Careful calculation of padding is required:

```
Koly Header Fields:
  magic + version + header_size + flags           = 16 bytes
  running_offset + data_offset + data_length      = 24 bytes
  rsrc_offset + rsrc_length                       = 16 bytes
  segment_number + segment_count + segment_id     = 24 bytes
  data_checksum_type + size + checksum            = 136 bytes
  plist_offset + plist_length                     = 16 bytes
  reserved                                        = 64 bytes
  master_checksum_type + size + checksum          = 136 bytes
  image_variant + sector_count                    = 12 bytes
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Subtotal                                        = 444 bytes
  Padding needed                                  = 68 bytes
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total                                           = 512 bytes
```

### 8. Raw Block Length

Read **`compressed_length` bytes** for a Raw run, never `sector_count * 512` —
the stored length is what is actually there, and reading past it walks into the
next run's data.

```rust
let size = block_run.compressed_length;
reader.read_exact(&mut output[..size])?;
```

In practice the two are the same. Every Raw run in the fixture images stores
exactly `sector_count * 512`; it is `Ignore` runs that store nothing, and their
whole meaning is "these sectors are zeros", so they never read at all.

A Raw run storing *less* than it declares is therefore a deviation, not a
normal case. The remainder is currently left zeroed and the deviation is not
reported — see the note on provisional handling in
[Coding](../../.claude/docs/CODING.md#provisional-strictness).

Earlier revisions of this document claimed the shortfall was routine "because
the writer stores the actual data size". That described this crate's own
pre-0.4.0 writer, which stored a short trailing chunk under a run declaring a
full sector, not anything a DMG creator does.

### 9. Checksum Verification

CRC32 checksums are stored in the first 4 bytes of 128-byte arrays (big-endian).

```rust
// Extract CRC32 from checksum array
let crc = u32::from_be_bytes(checksum_array[0..4].try_into()?);

// Zero checksum means "not set" - skip verification
if crc == 0 {
    return Ok(());
}
```

Three checksums exist:
- **Data fork checksum**: CRC32 of all compressed data blocks
- **Master checksum**: CRC32 of all partition checksums concatenated (4 bytes each)
- **Mish checksum**: CRC32 of the decompressed partition data (padded to sector boundary)

### 10. Partition Checksum Padding

When calculating mish checksums, data must be **padded to sector boundary** with zeros:

```rust
// Wrong - checksum of raw data
let checksum = crc32(data);  // ❌

// Correct - pad to sector boundary first
let sector_count = (data.len() + 511) / 512;
let padded_size = sector_count * 512;
let mut padded = data.to_vec();
padded.resize(padded_size, 0);
let checksum = crc32(&padded);  // ✓
```
